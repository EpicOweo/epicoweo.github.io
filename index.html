			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				Welcome to my page! I'm EpicOweo, or just Oweo/Oreo. I'm a university student from the USA
				studying for my B.S. in Computer Engineering. Some of my favorite things are cats, games, 
				learning, working on computers, hardware/software development, good food, plushies,
				etc etc etc (I like a lot of things). In the future, I would love to live in Europe with
				a successful engineering career, a master's degree, and of course my very own cats.

			<h3>Important notes for employers, recruiters, etc</h3>
			<p>
				If you're referring to this page due to an IRL reason, then you likely know 
				my real life name already. The reason I'm going by my username here is because
				that's how the page was first set up years ago, and I'd rather avoid intermingling
				my real life and online identities when it's not necessary, nor would I like to make
				a second Github account. Please let me know via our standard route of communication
				if needed and I can provide evidence that this is my page!
